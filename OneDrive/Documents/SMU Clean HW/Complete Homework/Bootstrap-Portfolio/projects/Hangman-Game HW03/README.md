# Hangman-Game

### SMU BOOTCAMP TRILOGY

This is my Pulpfiction hangman game. Taking design inspiration from the 90's cult classic. The game features fanart and a color scheme and layout to transpart you in dark world no one would ever want to actually visit. Try to guess the characters names. while looking at the wallpaper inspired by zed.
