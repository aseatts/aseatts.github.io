#BAMAZON
A shopping app for my dad.
My dad hates shopping and love CLI. If my dad had to shop, this is how he would do it. Bamazon is like Amazon with all the whistle but none of the bells. We focus on getting you the things we are selling in a somewhat cumbersome way.
First, we will list all of the items we have available for purchase. Then, we ask you to enter the sku or product Id so if there is a type-o, o-well. Next if you try to order more then we have in inventory, we let you know right away.
Steps to get you started using Bamazon (Better Amazon).

1. Install Node on your home PC.
2. Clone my repo. https://github.com/aseatts/bamazon.git
3. Open your terminal and type. “node bamazonCustomer.js”
4. Then a table will be printed in front you with the rest of the instructions to place an order.
5. When complete, wait for you items to be delivered. It might take a while? I think we might have forgotten to charge you.
